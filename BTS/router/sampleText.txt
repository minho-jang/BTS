0.3:hello guys welcome to my new video
3.51:in this video I'll be talking to your loss
6.39:si si bar sexy architectures
11.309:so in this memory memory one word is there are different products that is equal to 3 into 8 bit into 8 bit that will make 3 bytes 3 bytes make one word and there are toasters to raise to 20 memory locations that means there are two on7e is to 20 bytes that is equal to one megabyte
37.77:now we see registers registers
46.28:do some pneumonic codes
50.64:a stands for register 0 that is actually later exchanged for one that is index register
57.149:we have seen in the previous video
59.91:L stands for register 2 this is linkage sister
65.72:we are seen in the previous video
71.1:B stands for base register this
75.659:it holds the value of the base address and s T and F know s and T are in general registers and F stands for floating point accumulator
89.1:and we have seen in si si
94.11:there is no floating point but in this here floating point accumulator that is 48 bits next PC
101.009:we are seen in the previous video that is program counter it counts
111.45:it counts which feed bits instruction is running
119.21:Chester V stands for status word which includes condition codes Exeter
124.95:now we see the data formats
133.05:there are three or four data
